## Quick Reference: Key Concepts and Terminology
* Why use Time Series Insights?
  * Time Series Insights gives a business the ability to examine historical data over long periods of time, including:
  * Discovery of data
  * Trending of data over time
  * Anomaly detection over time with basic machine learning
