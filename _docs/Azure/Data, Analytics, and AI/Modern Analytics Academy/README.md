# Modern Analytics Academy

Welcome to the Modern Analytics Academy (MAA)!

The Modern Analyics Academy consists of several modules designed to illustrate and upskill on modern techniques, principles, and technologies available on the Microsoft Azure platform. The content will explore analytics in Microsoft Azure, Azure Synapse Analytics, data modeling and storage, event processing, data governance, and Power BI. 

The content is designed to be highly integrated but loosely coupled: each module stands on its own, while collectively representing a cohesive piece of common modern-day analytical solutions. If you just want to dive into Power BI or Data Governance, for example, you can simply pick those modules. Those new to Azure or Analytics in general may prefer to work through all modules.

## Hands-on Content

Each module contains several options for hands-on learning. In most cases, there are multiple options available designed to meet your specific skilling needs, from simple tutorial/demo content to more advanced workshops. We understand that some people may just want to see demos while others want to dive deep; most are somewhere in between. Use the content that best suits you!

## Table of Contents

The structure of the content is represented in the table below; the overview session is a high level overview focusing on concepts and principles, while each of the 'module' sessions, Data Acquisition through Visualiztion, will be more in-depth. Each session will contain one or more presentations, with several suggested labs and workshop content in each module designed to accomodate various skill levels and time availability.

Refer to links below for the module breakouts.

## Hands-on provisioned Environments

For a limited time, we have lab environments that can be provisioned for a period of time in order to assist in lab work. Depending on the specific lab/workshop, these environments may be provisioned will all of the materials and lab guidance ready to go; in other cases it may simply be an emtpy environment where you'll have to provision all of the resources manually.
