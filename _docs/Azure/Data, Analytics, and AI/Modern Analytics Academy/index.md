# Welcome to the Modern Analytics Academy

The Modern Analyics Academy consists of several modules designed to illustrate and upskill on modern techniques, principles, and technologies available on the Microsoft Azure platform. The content will explore Azure Synapse Analytics, data modelling and storage, event processing, data governance, and Power BI. 

The content is designed to be *highly integrated* but *loosely coupled*: each module stands on its own, while collectively representing a cohesive piece of common modern-day analytical solutions. If you just want to dive into Power BI or Data Governance, for example, you can simply pick those modules. Those new to Azure or Analytics in general may prefer to work through all modules.

# Hands-on Content

Each module contains several options for hands-on learning. In most cases, there are multiple options available designed to meet your specific skilling needs, from simple tutorial/demo content to more advanced workshops. We understand that some people may just want to see demos while others want to dive deep; most are somewhere in between. Use the content that best suits you!

# Table of Contents

The structure of the content is represented in the table below; refer to the links below to explore each module.
