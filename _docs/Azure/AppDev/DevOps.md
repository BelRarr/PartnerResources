# Learning Plan Resources for DevOps

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) - it's the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers. Learn more about DevOps fundamentals in the [DevOps Resource Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/what-is-devops).

## What is Microsoft's DevOps strategy?

Azure DevOps has empowered 1000s of enterprises for 15+ years with rich features to support developer innovation, standardization and automation. 

GitHub is the planet's largest developer platform...home to 65 million+ developers who build software collaboratively. GitHub brings an open source culture that improves communication, sharing of knowledge and improved code reuse.

Our strategy - over the coming years - is to bring the best of both products together into a single product experience - in GitHub - to provide the broadest set of software development capabilities that meet the needs of every developer and enterprise. Azure DevOps will continue to evolve with the industry, and we are committed to supporting and investing in Azure DevOps while we execute on our longer-term strategy. 

## Choosing between GitHub or Azure DevOps

When deciding between Azure DevOps or GitHub, it may not be one or the other - but a combination of the two. We encourage you to:

- First, explore GitHub and it's unique capabilities like [GitHub Actions](), [Advanced Security](), [Codespaces]().
- Move/create your repo to GitHub to take advantage of [code & secret scanning](), [Dependabot]() for vulnerability alerts and remediation and [Codespaces]() - even if you plan to use Azure DevOps for the rest of the DevOps lifecycle (i.e., Boards, Pipelines).
- Leverage [Boards](), [Artifacts]() and [Test Plans]() in Azure DevOps in conjunction with GitHub as needed.
- Review the [GitHub public roadmap]() to see/track upcoming features.

## GitHub Fundamentals

GitHub is much more than a code repository. [Watch sessions on-demand](https://githubuniverse.com/on-demand/) from GitHub Universe (GitHub's annual developer conference) to quickly learn more. Recommended sessions:
- Get a tour of GitHub's latest features and capabilities in Nat Friedman's (CEO @ GitHub) [keynote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m9nUP-e8Co).
- Erica Brescia, COO @ GitHub, reviews the benefits of [using GitHub Enterprise to increase velocity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl2QDxG4gt4) by focusing on the developer experience.
- Maya Ross, Director of Product - Enterprise @ GitHub, walks through the features of [GitHub Enterprise](https://githubuniverse.com/Accelerating-software-development-safely-with-GitHub-Enterprise/) and much more.
- [Catching vulnerabilities early with GitHub](https://githubuniverse.com/Catching-vulnerabilities-early-with-GitHub/) focuses on shifting security left to allow development teams to implement security controls and catch vulnerabilities in your upstream dependencies earlier.
- Join Allison Weins, Product Manager @ GitHub, for a [deep-dive into GitHub Codespaces](https://githubuniverse.com/GitHub-Codespaces-beyond-the-basics/) â€” an online development environment service that allows you to develop entirely in the cloud. 

## Deployment Options and Pricing

GitHub provides the following deployment options:
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud for security, compliance and cloud-based deployment 
- GitHub Enterprise Server for self-hosted security and compliance
- [GitHub AE](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-github-ae) for a fully managed, reliable, and scalable, allowing you to accelerate delivery without sacrificing risk management. Designed for customers who need to meet stringent security and compliance requirements.
