Business Central offers an add-in for Microsoft Outlook that allows users to streamline business interactions with customers and vendors, directly in Microsoft Outlook. With the Business Central add-in for Outlook, users can see financial data related to customers and vendors, and quickly create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices from inbound emails.
