Welcome to the AI & ML Academy (AIMLA)! 

The AI & ML Academy consists of several modules designed to illustrate and upskill on modern techniques, principles, and technologies available on the Microsoft Azure platform. The content will explore ... 

The content is designed to be highly integrated but loosely coupled: each module stands on its own, while collectively representing a cohesive piece of modern-day AI and ML solutions. If you just want to dive into **replace with AI/ML services...** Power BI or Data Governance, for example, you can simply pick those modules. Those new to Azure or AI in general may prefer to work through all modules, starting with the Overview.

## Live Schedule

We'll update this section with our upcoming vignette series available as a webcast and all content will be included here.

## Table of Contents

The structure of the content is represented in the table below; the overview session is a high level overview focusing on concepts and principles, while each of the 'module' sessions, Pre-Built AI through MLOps, will be more in-depth. Each session will contain one or more presentations, with several suggested labs and workshop content in each module designed to accomodate various skill levels and time availability.

Refer to links below for the module breakouts.

## Hands-on provisioned Environments

We are not currently offering fully-hosted lab environments for AI & ML Academy, but this may change in the future as we expand the content. In the meantime, you can still run the labs in your own Azure subscription. These labs are listed below:

<!--
Want to go hands-on with a fully provisioned environment? Check out our AI & ML Academy lab environments hosted by Spektra Systems, available for a limited time. The environments are only available to United States based partners.

* Sign-up link: [https://bit.ly/3COKiz1](https://bit.ly/3COKiz1)
* Activation code: ACTIVATE1365

The lab environments available are listed below. The source content is available if you'd like to see what's covered in each lab -- however, the lab environment will display all of this info for you as you progress through the lab. Once the lab environment is started, there is a limited time to complete the lab due to the number of resources provisioned. If you'd like to keep all of the assets as you go through the lab, we recommend following the lab guides listed below and deploy the resources into your Azure account.
