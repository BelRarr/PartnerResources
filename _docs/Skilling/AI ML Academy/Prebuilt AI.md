# AI & ML Academy - Prebuilt AI

Welcome to the AI & ML Academy (AIMLA) - Prebuilt AI!

In this section we will go through an overview of the AI Cognitive Services pillars and what services reside within each of them. There is also a level of customization that can be achieved in each of these pillars through services like Custom Vision and Custom Speech that we will introduce.  Finally, we provide some best practices for each of these services.

## AI Cognitive Services

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help you build cognitive intelligence into your applications. They are available as REST APIs, client library SDKs, and user interfaces. You can add cognitive features to your applications without having AI or data science skills. Cognitive Services enable you to build cognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even make decisions.

### Vision 

**Computer Vision**

Analyze content in images and video with a turn-key API service
- [Demo](https://aidemos.microsoft.com/computer-vision) - Sandbox demos to see what you can do with the Computer Vision API
-	[Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/gallery/featured) - Explore functionality by trying out each API (requires Azure account)
- [Computer Vision Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/explore-computer-vision-microsoft-azure/) - Get started analyzing images with the API

**Custom Vision**

Build custom Image Classification and Object Detection models for your scenario
- [Learning Path for Object Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/train-custom-vision-ai/) - Get started using AI to recognize objects in images using the Custom Vision service
- [Learning Path for Image Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/classify-images-custom-vision/) - Get started classifying images using the Custom Vision service
- [Rock Paper Scissors Code Sample](https://github.com/azure-samples/rock-paper-scissors-customvision/tree/master/) - Hands-on Lab to create Node.js app with Rock Paper Scissors custom image classifier

**Face API**

Detect and identify people in images
- [Face API Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/detect-analyze-faces/) - Get started detecting and analyzing faces 
- [Transparency Note](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/transparency-note-azure-cognitive-services-face-api/Face%20API%20Transparency%20Note%20(March%202019).pdf) - Understand how Face API works, the choices you can make as a system owner that influence accuracy, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment

### Speech

## Hands-on Content

Each module contains several options for hands-on learning. In most cases, there are multiple options available designed to meet your specific skilling needs, from simple tutorial/demo content to more advanced workshops. We understand that some people may just want to see demos while others want to dive deep; most are somewhere in between. Use the content that best suits you!

## Suggested Hands-on Labs (HOL) / Workshops
