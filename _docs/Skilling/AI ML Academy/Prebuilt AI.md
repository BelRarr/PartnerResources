# AI & ML Academy - Prebuilt AI

Welcome to the AI & ML Academy (AIMLA) - Prebuilt AI!

In this section we will go through an overview of the AI Cognitive Services pillars and what services reside within each of them. There is also a level of customization that can be achieved in each of these pillars through services like Custom Vision and Custom Speech that we will introduce.  Finally, we provide some best practices for each of these services.

## Hands-on Content

Each module contains several options for hands-on learning. In most cases, there are multiple options available designed to meet your specific skilling needs, from simple tutorial/demo content to more advanced workshops. We understand that some people may just want to see demos while others want to dive deep; most are somewhere in between. Use the content that best suits you!
