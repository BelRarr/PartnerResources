##  Introduction to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
April 27, 2022

Our Azure Data Academy series will demonstrate the latest data-centric technologies on Microsoft Azure. In this session, Gennady Kostinsky introduces Azure Database for PostgreSQL, a fully managed PaaS service allowing you to focus on application innovation, not database management. The Flexible Server architecture provides single-zone or zone-redundant high availability to suit application needs.
