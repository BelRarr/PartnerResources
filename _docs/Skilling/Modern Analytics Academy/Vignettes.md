## Vignette #1 - What is Data Governance?
April 5, 2022

In this high level session, we'll explore what data governance is, why we need it, and the people, processes, and technology needed to implement a data governance strategy. This presentation is primarily for those new to data governance, looking for guidance on best practices, or planning a strategy for evolving their current data governance strategy.
